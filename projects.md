I always strive to make out time for projects. I
have tried to engage in projects that require me to
work outside my comfort and knowledge set to keep on
learning new languages and development techniques to
improve myself continuously. It has always been my intention to open source my
projects and code so that people can access, learn,
provide feedback and build upon it. Here, I have
listed some of my favorite projects. You can look at
them all on my [Github page][gh-sangeetds]
